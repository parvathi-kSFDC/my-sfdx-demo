SFDX + Jenkins + PMD Integration

This project demonstrates Salesforce DX (SFDX) development with Jenkins CI/CD and PMD code quality checks.

ðŸ”¹ Branch Strategy

main â†’ Production-ready code.

develop â†’ Active development branch.

feature/* â†’ Short-lived branches for new features or bug fixes.

ðŸ”¹ Branch Protection Rules

Configured in GitHub under Settings â†’ Branches:

main and develop are protected.

Direct pushes are blocked.

Pull Requests are required.

At least 1 reviewer approval is mandatory.

Jenkins status checks must pass before merging.
